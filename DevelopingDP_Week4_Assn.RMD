## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(USArrests)

require(graphics)
pairs(USArrests, panel = panel.smooth, main = "USArrests data")

## Difference between 'USArrests' and its correction
USArrests["Maryland", "UrbanPop"] # 67 -- the transcription error
UA.C <- USArrests
UA.C["Maryland", "UrbanPop"] <- 76.6

## also +/- 0.5 to restore the original  <n>.5  percentages
s5u <- c("Colorado", "Florida", "Mississippi", "Wyoming")
s5d <- c("Nebraska", "Pennsylvania")
UA.C[s5u, "UrbanPop"] <- UA.C[s5u, "UrbanPop"] + 0.5
UA.C[s5d, "UrbanPop"] <- UA.C[s5d, "UrbanPop"] - 0.5
